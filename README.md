# Simplex-Algorithm
A Very Simple and Neat Script to solve optimiztion problems using simplex method.
This is done by Access Simplex.xls Sheet1 as your data source for Decision variables coeffiecients and Resources Availability.
Snippets :
          Make sure your Wanted to optimized function's variables' coeffiecients are'nt the same just edit the code if that occurs.
          The script was written for 2 Decision variables problem just edit Matrices Dimensions and indexation for enlargement.
